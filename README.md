# Link-Apprenticeship-Coding-Exercise
My take on the Link Apprenticeship Coding Exercise for 2017.

Testing dependancies. This project uses Mocha and Chai to test. 
It was last testing in the Node.js command prompt using Node.js 4.6.0 (x64)

Install mocha using npm install mocha. Chai version 3.5.0 is already included in the repository.
