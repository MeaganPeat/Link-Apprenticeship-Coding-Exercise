# Link-Apprenticeship-Coding-Exercise
My take on the Link Apprenticeship Coding Exercise for 2017.

Testing dependancies. This project uses mocha and chai to test the function.

(Using the node.js terminal npm install mocha)
//gonna go home and try to run it on my own computer to clairify the lists of dependancies and get versions
