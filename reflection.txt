The problem itself was easy to understand and implement. The logic part was easy. I really enjoy solving problems like this in JavaScript. The logic is easy to break down into chunks and small steps.

This was my first time using Mocha and Chai, and also my first time really using Node.js for a project. (I have previous experince with using the command line and have used a little bit of node in other projects , but not for testing).

I think the learning curve for Mocha and Chai was reletively simple.
